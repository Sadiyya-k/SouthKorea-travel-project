            <h2>Why South Korea</h2>
            <h3>South Korea, the land of K-Pop</h3>
            <p>
              South Korea is famous for K-pop, delicious Korean foods, ancient
              temples, and dynamic festivals. South Korea is an eastern Asian
              country. It is located on the Korean Peninsula, with the Yellow
              Sea on the west and the Sea of Japan on the east. Korean popular
              music, termed K-Pop, is a versatile genre that originates in South
              Korea. Whilst it includes a variety of styles such as pop, R&B,
              hip-hop, and jazz, some common themes run. For example, K-Pop
              choreography is known to have a fast tempo, predominantly
              performed in unison. Groups also often wear vibrant, distinct
              outfits which match the aesthetic of the group.

              eju, the largest island in South Korea, is famous for its tranquil
              beach resorts and delicious seafood. It is located in the Korea
              Strait, meaning that it sits in three different seas. These are
              the East China Sea, Japan Sea, and Yellow Sea. Jeonju is
              considered to be the food capital of South Korea. It is famous for
              its delicious street foods, as well as the food festivals centered
              around them.
